# WP LOCALIZE SCRIPT 
## Accessing a PHP mult-dimensional array within a Javascript file in Wordpress

The aim of this is to give an example of how to use the wp_localize_script
when you have an array of database query results from your Wordpress
database that you wish to access in a Javascript file.

In the example, we pass in a PHP multi-dimensional array of edited results
to an enqueued Javascript file.
